automatically backup other clusters.

The Backup Roll has several key features. 
When a backup image is generated, it is directly streamed to the computer 
performing the backup, so that no hard disk space is occupied on the computer 
being backed up. In addition, the Backup Roll uses the industry standard 
OpenSSL, Apache, and python M2Crypto in order to perform backups that are both 
quick and secure.
