<para>

The Backup Roll must be installed during the Frontend installation step
of your cluster (refer to section 1.2 of the Rocks usersguide). Note that
the Backup Roll must be installed on both the server(machine to backed up)
and the client(machine that backs up the server).
</para>


<para>
The Backup Roll is added to a Frontend installation in exactly the same
manner as the required HPC Roll. After the HPC Roll is
added the installer will once again ask if you have a Roll (see
below).  Select 'Yes' and insert the Backup Roll.
