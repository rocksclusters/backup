The project uses the Sun Industry Standards Source License, or
SISSL. This license is recognized as a free and open license by the
Free Software Foundation and the Open Source Initiative
respectively. This license is a good license where interoperability
and commercial considerations are important. Under the SISSL license a
user may do what they like with the source base, such as modifing it
and extending it, but the user must maintain compatibility if they
want to provide their modified version to others. It is not mandatory
for the user to contribute back code changes to the project, though of
course this is encouraged. If a user wishes to make available a
modified version which is not compatible with the project, the license
requires that the licensee must provide a reference implementation of
sources which constitute the modification, thereby opening the details
of any incompatibility/modification which has been
introduced. Additionally the non-compliant modified version cannot use
the Grid Engine name.
